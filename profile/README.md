UMA lets anyone send and receive money (fiat and crypto) 24/7 using their favorite UMA-enabled wallet, exchange, or bank. UMA is global and open source.
This github org contains repos for the protocol specification as well as SDKs for several different languages.

## [Protocol Spec Repository](https://github.com/uma-universal-money-address/protocol)

This is the source of truth protocol definition for UMA. All proposed spec changes should be sent as PRs to this repo. Note that UMA is an extension of LNURL. If your proposal is also applicable to LNURL, the preference should be to propose a new LUD.

This repo is organized as a set of individual documents describing a single message or component of the protocol.
